My solutions to some of the [Advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

I lost the solutions for the first two days, because they were one-liners in
the IRB. 

For the remaining ones, easy puzzles will still be quick'n'dirty, but more
difficult puzzles will obviously require more careful work.
